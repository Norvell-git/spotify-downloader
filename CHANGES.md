## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - N.A.
### Changed
- Exit with an appropriate code on bad arguments. ([@ritiek](https://github.com/ritiek)) (#736)

## [2.0.6] - 26-05-2020
### Fixed
- Fix crash if YouTube search results contains live streams
  ([@ritiek](https://github.com/ritiek) (#735)
- Skip invalid tracks returned on playlist endpoint with Spotify Web-API
  ([@ritiek](https://github.com/ritiek)) (#732)

## [2.0.5] - 20-05-2020
### Fixed
- In some cases when using `-f` to create sub-directories from metadata, where the
  full slugified download filename and the non-slugified download directory happen
  to differ, the download would fail. The download directory will now be derived from
  filename itself so that the sub-directory name always overlaps.

## [2.0.0] - 18-05-2020
### Migrating from v1.2.6 to v2.0.0
For v2.0.0 to work correctly, you need to remove your previous `config.yml` due to
breaking changes in v2.0.0 (marked as **[Breaking]** in the below sections), new options being
added, and old ones being removed. You may want to first backup your old configuration for
reference.  You can then install spotdl v2.0.0 and remove your current configuration by
running:
```
$ spotdl --remove-config
```
spotdl will automatically generate a new configuration file on the next run. You can
then replace the appropriate fields in the newly generated configuration file by
referring to your old configuration file.

All the below changes were made as a part of #690.

### Added
- `-i` now accepts `automatic` which would automatically select the best available stream
  irrespective of the format.
- Added parameter `-q` (`--quality {best,worst}`) to select best (default) or worst audio quality.
- Added `-ne` (`--no-encode`) to disable encoding.
- Output to STDOUT with `-f -`.
- Output to STDOUT with `--write-to -`.
- Read tracks from STDIN in `-s` parameter.
- Display a combined *download & encode* progress bar.

### Changed
- **[Breaking]** Tracks are now downloaded in the current working directory (instead of
  user's Music directory) by default.
- **[Breaking]** Short for `--album` is now `-a` instead of `-b`.
- **[Breaking]** Short for `--all-albums` is now `-aa` instead of `-ab`.
- Allow "&" character in filenames.
- **[Breaking]** Merge parameters `-ff` and `-f` to `-f` (`--output-file`).
- **[Breaking]** Do not prefix formats with a dot when specifying `-i` and `-o` parameters
  Such as `-o .mp3` is now written as `-o mp3`.
- **[Breaking]** Search format now uses hyphen for word break instead of underscore. Such as
  `-sf "{artist} - {track_name}"` is now written as `-sf "{artist} - {track-name}"`.
- **[Breaking]** `--write-successful` and `--skip` is renamed to `--write-successful-file` and
  `--skip-file` respectively.
- Partial re-write and internal API refactor.
- Enhance debug log output readability.
- Internally adapt to latest changes made in Spotipy library.
- Switch to `logging` + `coloredlogs` instead of `logzero`. Our loggers weren't being
  setup properly with `logzero`.
- Simplify checking for an downloaded already track. Previously it also analyzed metadata
  for the already downloaded track to determine whether to overwrite the already downloaded
  track, which caused unexpected behvaiours at times.
- Codebase is now more modular making it easier to use spotdl in python scripts.
- `config.yml` now uses underscores for separating between argument words instead of
  hyphens for better compatibility with `argparse`.

### Optimized
- Track download and encoding now happen parallely instead of sequentially making spotdl
  faster.
- Lyrics and albumart are now downloaded in the background while the track is being downloaded
  instead of in the end. This reduces additional delays if we are to download them while applying
  metadata.
- `--write-m3u` now only scrapes YouTube for required metadata making it much faster.
  Previously, it was also required to parse it via an external YouTube parsing library
  which was slow.
- Switch to PyTube from Pafy. PyTube is faster and relies only on scraping.

### Removed
- **[Breaking]** Removed Avconv support. Only FFmpeg is supported now.
- **[Breaking]** Removed `--no-fallback-metadata` parameter since not many people seem to find it useful.
- **[Breaking]** Removed apparently misleading `--download-only-metadata` parameter.
- **[Breaking]** Removed ability to set YouTube API key since we now use PyTube instead of Pafy, and
  PyTube does not require an API key.
- **[Breaking]** As a side effect of above, `--music-videos-only` is also removed as this feature worked only
  with YouTube API.
